Download Note:
In order to make the process easier, I have uploaded the game to itch.io (a platform to distribute,download and play indie games) in which I provided the link https://gabby23x.itch.io/worldwalker . The website will show you where to download the executable in order to play the game. The process should be smooth and the game should start as soon as it's downloaded. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you run into any problems.
